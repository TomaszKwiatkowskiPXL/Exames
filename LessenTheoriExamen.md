# Networks theory

*peer to peer*
  What is peer- to -peer?
  - Peer to peer is a way of using personal computers as servers.
    its commonly used for home servers even some video games use it for example gta v online uses the client with the best internet
    as the main server that keeps all users together.


## Network Media

We can send signals in 3 different ways,

  - Copper cable
  - Fiber optic
  - Wireless

Extra's
- Devices that that participate in network communication are Host
  (Toestellen bv tv modem(instel pagina dus toestellen met een locale http bv 192.168.1.8 is een mogelijke modem imnstell pagina))

- Intermediary devices are devices that enable and manage data flow over a network, such as switches, routers, and access points.

  Intermediary devices connect the individual end devices to the network.
  They can connect multiple individual networks to
  form an internetwork. These intermediary devices provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.

## Physical Topology Diagrams

Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation,
as shown in the figure. You can see that the rooms in which these devices are located are labeled in this physical topology.

## Logical Topology Diagrams

Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network, as shown in the figure.
You can see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.


# Network sizes

- Small home Networks
- Small office and home office Networks
- Medium & Large Networks
- World wide Networks (Facility's ex Amzazon France or China etc)


## LANs and WANs
  -  WAN -> Wide area Network
  -  Local area Network

LAN -> Building Local Network infrastructure
WAN -> Outside router Networks
