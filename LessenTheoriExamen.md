# Networks theory

*peer to peer*
  What is peer- to -peer?
  - Peer to peer is a way of using personal computers as servers.
    its commonly used for home servers even some video games use it for example gta v online uses the client with the best internet
    as the main server that keeps all users together.


## Network Media

We can send signals in 3 different ways,

  - Copper cable
  - Fiber optic
  - Wireless

Extra's
- Devices that that participate in network communication are Host
  (Toestellen bv tv modem(instel pagina dus toestellen met een locale http bv 192.168.1.8 is een mogelijke modem imnstell pagina))

- Intermediary devices are devices that enable and manage data flow over a network, such as switches, routers, and access points.

  Intermediary devices connect the individual end devices to the network.
  They can connect multiple individual networks to
  form an internetwork. These intermediary devices provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.

## Physical Topology Diagrams

Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation,
as shown in the figure. You can see that the rooms in which these devices are located are labeled in this physical topology.

## Logical Topology Diagrams

Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network, as shown in the figure.
You can see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.


# Network sizes

- Small home Networks
- Small office and home office Networks
- Medium & Large Networks
- World wide Networks (Facility's ex Amzazon France or China etc)


## LANs and WANs
  -  WAN -> Wide area Network
  -  Local area Network

LAN -> Building Local Network infrastructure
WAN -> Outside router Networks

## Fault tolerance

Some company's own multiple router wich are connectted in parralel to prevent the network from colapsing
incase of an router making an error, the other routers use wil take over the job of the defect router.
Also the left over space might be used for an temponary network ex an extra room makes use of safety reserved networks for an event where
more IT has to function.


### As new technologies and end-user devices come to market, businesses and consumers must continue to adjust to this ever-changing environment.
There are several networking trends that affect organizations and consumers:

   - Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
   - Online collaboration
   - Video communications

## Cloud Computing

# Powerline Networking
- Send data trough frequentie bv TP Link extenders for network
- 1 Ethernet input, multiple hubs that search inputs connection.


## Security

  - Viruses, worms, and Trojan horses - These contain malicious software or code running on a user device.
  - Spyware and adware - These are types of software which are installed on a user’s device. The software then secretly collects information about the user.
  - Zero-day attacks - Also called zero-hour attacks, these occur on the first day that a vulnerability becomes known.
  - Threat actor attacks - A malicious person attacks user devices or network resources.
  - Denial of service attacks - These attacks slow or crash applications and processes on a network device.
  - Data interception and theft - This attack captures private information from an organization’s network.
  - Identity theft - This attack steals the login credentials of a user in order to access private data.


1.8.2 Security Solutions

  - Antivirus and antispyware - These applications help to protect end devices from becoming infected with malicious software.
  - Firewall filtering - Firewall filtering blocks unauthorized access into and out of the network. This may include a host-based firewall system that prevents        unauthorized access to the end device, or a basic filtering service on the home router to prevent unauthorized access from the outside world into the network.

  - Dedicated firewall systems - These provide more advanced firewall capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic with more granularity.
  - Access control lists (ACL) - These further filter access and traffic forwarding based on IP addresses and applications.
  - Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) - These identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks.
  - Virtual private networks (VPN) - These provide secure access into an organization for remote workers.



CCNA is an certification 

# Theman 2

OS: Operating systems
- Shell -> what users see
- translate input for hardware
- Hardware -> GPU,CPU,RAM ect


GUI -> OS:UI ex Ubuntu/Windows Destkop.
CLI -> Ex Ubuntu server command prompt

## Deivce external acces is possible trough
- .SSH
- Console
- Telnet

Example programs
- puTTY
- Tera term
- Secure CRT

Extra's
U can acces devices trough Telephone connection using AUX apparently.

## IOS Command stucture
